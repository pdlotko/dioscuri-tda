						Name: Asier L&oacute;pez-Gord&oacute;n :  A friendly invitation to geometric mechanics
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Differential geometry is the natural language for studying mechanical systems, as well as classical field theories, quantisation, control theory, etc. Understanding the geometry underlying a dynamical system provides a plethora of methods for studying the system, either quantitatively or qualitatively, analytically or numerically. I will start my talk by recalling some basic notions of differential geometry (requiring the audience only knowledge of linear algebra, elementary calculus, and some general topology). After that, I will present the main ideas of symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics. I will conclude by exposing how symplectic geometry can be used to construct numerical methods that preserve global properties of the original dynamical system (such as conservation of the energy or the volume).

						Name: Micha&#322; Bogdan: Agents, flocks, dynamic transitions- an opening for TDA?
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The talk will cover the basic strategies of modelling the
						behaviour of active groups and flocks of such biological agents as fish,
						birds, cells and bacteria using such models as the Vicsek model, the
						Toner-Tu model and related models. We will discuss the basic predictions of
						such models and progress to more recent developments. We will cover the
						first existing attempts to further the field by topological data analysis
						and ponder what uncovered potential of TDA there may yet to be realised.

						Name: Janusz Przewocki: Primer on mapper algorithm and its applications
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The Mapper algorithm, introduced by Singh, MÃ©moli, and Carlsson, is a key tool in topological data analysis for uncovering structure in complex data. In this talk, we will explore its theoretical foundations and examples from the original paper. We will also examine its impactful application related to disease-specific genomic analysis by Nicolau et al. In this talk, we aim to provide both theoretical understanding and practical insights into the use of Mapper in data science.

						Name: Julian Br&#252;ggemann: Discrete Morse theory, homology, and cancelling critical simplices
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we will introduce discrete Morse functions, their induced combinatorial gradient vector fields, and their flow lines. Then we will use these notions to compute Morse homology, prove the discrete Morse inequalities, and consider special cases in which discrete Morse functions can detect that a space is contractible or equivalent to a wedge of spheres. Afterwards, we will consider cancellation of critical simplices along unique flow lines and will discuss techniques on how to find such cancellations.

						Mateusz Mas&#322;owski: Topological signatures of phase transitions:
						Insight from the 2D Ising Model 
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Phase transitions mark dramatic shifts in system behaviour as external parameters, such as temperature, change. While classical approaches often depend on defining a Hamiltonian, many complex systems lack a clear energy function. This talk explores a topological perspective on phase transitions, using the 2D Ising model as a classic example. Through Monte Carlo simulations with Metropolis and Wolff algorithms, I examine how spin configurations evolve with temperature, uncovering topological patterns that signal critical behaviour. The broader aim is to establish a general method for detecting phase transitions, even in systems without an explicit Hamiltonian. This work lays the groundwork for future extensions to higher dimensions or more complex models.

						Davide Gurnari: Dimensionality reduction techniques: the good, the bad, the ugly
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk we will discuss some of the most famous and used techniques for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high dimensional datasets. By exploring the algorithms behind PCA, LDA, t-SNE and UMAP we will build intuition on the underlying principles and trade-offs of each method. We will discuss common pitfalls and challenges that can arise when applying these tools, offering insights into best practices for selecting the right approach for specific data analysis tasks.

						Niklas Hellmer: Probability Meets Topological Data
						Analysis
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b>In this talk, I will present a collection of results at the
						interface between probability and topological data analysis (TDA). From a
						data driven perspective, we assume that samples lie on or near a
						submanifold (hence, topology enters) in high-dimensional feature space and
						are governed by a (usually unknown) probability distribution. The results I
						present illustrate different aspects of cross-fertilization between the
						subjects and were obtained over the course of my PhD studies.</li>

						Julian Br&#252;ggemann: Spaces of discrete Morse functions, merge trees, and barcodes
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> This is a practice talk for the talk I am going to present at the AMS Special Session on the Open Neighborhood of Applied Topology at the Joint Maths Meeting of the AMS 2025. <br />
						Discrete Morse theory is a versatile tool from combinatorial algebraic topology. In a nutshell, discrete Morse theory uses certain well-behaved functions, the so-called discrete Morse functions, from the face poset of any regular CW complex to the real numbers. In addition to providing sublevel-filtrations, discrete Morse functions provide numerous tools to investigate topological properties and to find theoretic guarantees for various algorithms.
						Merge trees are combinatorial descriptors for the development of path components within different levels of filtered spaces. They have been introduced in the context of visualization, where they are used to approximate and compute contour trees. <br />
						In this talk, we consider the space of discrete Morse functions, investigate some basic properties, and see how this space is connected to spaces of merge trees and barcodes. Previous knowledge on discrete Morse theory will not be required for this talk, but some familiarity with posets (i.e. partially ordered sets) will be very helpful.

						Marta Marszewska: Using ECP for the Analysis of Dynamic Systems
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The seminar will explore the use of Euler Characteristic Profiles (ECP) as a tool for analyzing vector fields in dynamic systems. In addition to ECP, alternative approaches such as optimal transport metrics and histogram analysis will be introduced, offering new perspectives for understanding the structure and behavior of vector fields.

						Jakub Malinowski: Symmetries and crystallography
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> This talk is an introduction to the topic of space/crystallographic groups.
						During the talk, I will present the definition of space groups and classic
						Bieberbach theorems. As motivation, I will talk briefly about the use of
						symmetry in crystallography.

						Mateusz Mas&#322;owski: Efficient Techniques for Simulating One-Dimensional Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, we'll delve into the numerical modeling of one-dimensional electromagnetic waves in a vacuum. I'll introduce the basic concepts of Maxwell's equations in a simplified, one-dimensional form and discuss the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for solving these equations. We'll explore the role of the Green's function in this context, providing a framework for efficiently computing the evolution of electromagnetic fields. As motivation, I'll touch on the importance of electromagnetic wave modeling in applications like wireless communication and data transmission.

						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In our interconnected world, the study of networks provides
						valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems. This talk will
						explore some measures of centrality that identify influential elements
						within networks, examining how we can quantify importance across different
						network structures. Additionally, we will briefly discuss an interplay
						between network science and topological data analysis, highlighting how
						these areas complement each other in understanding network behavior.
