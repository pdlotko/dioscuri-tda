						Iason Papadopoulos(University of Bremen): Computation of an n-Parameter Generalized Rank Invariant Landscape
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> This talk is the second in a two-part series (the first one takes place in the Basic Notions and Applied Topology seminar) presenting a new vectorization method for multiparameter persistence modules with an arbitrary number of parameters. We describe an ongoing project that generalizes the Generalized Rank Invariant Landscape (GRIL), which is currently limited to two-parameter persistence. A key difficulty in extending GRIL lies in the computation of the GRI over certain intervals, which becomes challenging in higher dimensions. This computation depends on understanding the final and initial subposets of these intervals. In the two-parameter setting, their structure is well understood, making GRIL possible. In this talk, we show that minimal instances of such subposets exist for arbitrary posets, making the computation of the GRI feasible beyond two parameters. We will further outline what remains to be done and discuss current challenges.

						Björn Wehlin (KTH Royal Institute of Technology): Fast statistical computations for TDA with 'masspcf'
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, we have seen a lot of progress on fast computations of topological invariants for large point clouds. However, I will argue that serious thought should also be given to computation in the presence of small-to-moderately sized point clouds. Statistical analysis and optimization requires large amounts of data to be processed. Part of the reason machine learning has become so successful is because of efficient computational tools that scale across very large datasets and which can leverage modern computing hardware. In TDA, we work with a lot of piecewise constant invariants (Euler characteristic curves, Betti curves, stable ranks, etc.). Such functions pose computational challenges in that the invariants do not change at the same time points, and that they have different numbers of time points. I will present my software library, 'masspcf', for Python and C++, with native support for working with multidimensional arrays of piecewise constant functions. The library automatically makes use of multiple CPUs and GPUs (if present) for accelerating computations.

						Aleksandra Górecka (Adam Mickiewicz University): Online Ramsey numbers: a path vs. a matching. 
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In my presentation, I will discuss the results of research on Ramsey games on ordered graphs. I will focus on the analysis of the edge Ramsey number for ordered matchings and paths, with particular emphasis on the pairs $(M_k, P_4)$. I will show how vertex ordering affects Ramsey numbers and what differences arise compared to unordered cases. I will present new upper bounds, exact values determined for small parameters, and results obtained for other classes of graphs. I will also outline the main idea of the C++ code, which was used to compute the values of $r_o$ for small parameters $k$ and to estimate $r_o(M_6, P_5)$.

						Sylwester Piątek (Wrocław University of Science and Technology):  Applications of Ball-Based Linear Regression and Ball Mapper in Explainable AI
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a novel regression method called Ball-Based Linear Regression (BBLR). This approach combines the simplicity and interpretability of linear regression with the flexibility of local modeling. By optimising the hyperparameters of the BBLR model, we can achieve a good balance between explainability and predictive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the BBLR method on several synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that it can compete with different local regression methods such as LOESS and it can outperform them in certain scenarios. In some fields it is crucial to systematically explain the machine learning models used in the decision-making process. Applying topological data analysis (TDA) tools such as Mapper, BallMapper or ClusterGraph to the data set can reveal more details about its local structure. Combining these EDA tools with post-hoc explainable AI methods such as SHAP or LIME leads to a better understanding not only of the data set itself but also of the complex models built on them. We propose a novel tool for visualisation of the local explanations of machine learning models with a global structure of the dataset. This tool can also use BBLR instead of LIME to obtain the explanations. This approach has shown its usefulness on a number of synthetic data sets with known ground truth as well as real data examples showing the potential application to real life problems. The presentation is based on a joint work with Paweł Dłotko, Rafał Topolnicki, and Simon Rudkin.

						Zoltán Somogyvári: Topological theorems in action: inference of hidden common driver dynamics by anisotropic self-organizing neural networks
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, a novel approach is introduced for inferring the dynamics of hidden common drivers by analyzing time series data from two driven dynamical systems. Our method builds upon dimensional causality analysis, which can detect the presence of an unobserved common driver influencing the observed systems. The inference process utilizes time-delay embedding, estimation of the intrinsic dimensions of the observed systems, and their mutual dimension. The applicability of our dimensional causality analysis method is demonstrated on time series of epileptic measurements, where they hold the potential to determine seizure onset zones. We demonstrate how the topological properties of the attractor manifolds are leveraged and present a new anisotropic training algorithm for self-organizing neural maps, enabling accurate learning of the topological structure of these manifolds and facilitating the estimation of the hidden common driver's time series. The proposed method is rigorously tested on simulated time series from nonlinearly coupled chaotic systems. It exhibits superior performance compared to several established methods, including linear techniques such as Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis, as well as nonlinear approaches like Slow Feature Analysis, Dynamical Component Analysis, Canonical Correlation Analysis, and Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis.

						Abel H. G. Milor: Bridging the geometrical properties across the scales with the persistent homology.
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In material science, focus is given on always more complex architected material structures, called metamaterials, designed to achieve specific mechanical or optical cross-scales properties. This multiscale consideration of the material arrangement necessitates to develop an understanding of the interdependency of the different scales of their structural geometry. In this talk, we will focus on a specific long-range geometrical correlation called the hyperuniformity and we will see how its presence affects and can be inferred from the local geometrical arrangements as captured by the persistent homology. While focusing on point patterns, we will show how to extract global geometrical information from the persistence diagram and how one can describe the large-scale geometry from local arrangements via machine learning models. Furthermore, we will present an algorithm to construct efficiently a large point pattern aiming for a persistence diagram and see how the global properties are affected.

						Jacek Gulgowski: Cellular Automata and topological questions
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> It is obvious that Cellular Automata (CA) are not only Conway's Game of Life or Wolfram's 1D elementary automata - the realm of the ideas is much bigger and offers much more. If we look at CA from the right perspective, we can see a discrete in time dynamical system acting on some configuration space. This makes it a very nice modelling tool – but not only this. In some cases it is natural to assume the evolution of such system conserves some quantities (like mass or energy) – and this leads us to the concept of number-conserving (or density-conserving) CA. I am going to present some of the fresh results in the area of number conserving cellular automata and state some questions of topological nature, which may be asked in relation to the evolution of configuration spaces defined by such automata. One of the interesting observations is related to some phase-transition effects when the density of configuration changes.

						Giuliamaria Menara: Structural properties of eulerian magnitude homology
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Magnitude homology, introduced by Hepworth and Willerton in 2017,
						is a combinatorially defined graph invariant that categorifies magnitude.
						Eulerian magnitude homology, introduced by Giusti and Menara in 2024, is a
						variant of magnitude homology. Although magnitude homology and eulerian
						magnitude homology are quite close homology theories, they satisfy
						different algebraic and combinatorial properties, and in this talk we aim
						to explore the structural features of eulerian magnitude homology.
						We will start by analyzing the diagonality conditions of eulerian magnitude
						homology, providing a characterization of complete graphs. Then, we will
						construct the regular magnitude-path spectral sequence as the spectral
						sequence of the (filtered) injective nerve of the reachability category,
						and we will see that such spectral sequence converges to the complex of
						injective words on a digraph.

						Benedikt Kolbe: Entangled graphs in 3-space from mapping class groups and persistent homology algorithms 
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> This talk has two parts. The first is heavily inspired by applications and will discuss recent breakthroughs concerning an inherently interdisciplinary project between mathematicians, physicists, chemists, and computer scientists that attempts to produce structures in three-dimensional Euclidean space from graph embeddings on triply-periodic minimal surfaces. We present in this talk a recent new application, relevant for crystallography, materials science, structure formation, and knot theory, of the mapping class group (MCG) of a surface, a prominent object that has received considerable attention in pure mathematics. We explain how to apply the MCG to the construction of candidates for new crystalline structures from graph embeddings on surfaces, where intrinsically hyperbolic triply-periodic minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space are used as a scaffold for promising
						three-periodic structures. We then give an overview of new results on MCGs that facilitates an enumeration of isotopy classes of graph embeddings with a given group of symmetries and conclude with a catalogue of three-dimensional structures that have resulted from this project. We also discuss ongoing work on using methods from topological data analysis and particularly persistent homology to analyze the resulting entangled structures.
						
						In the second part of the talk, we discuss recent advances in ongoing projects on shape reconstruction and algorithmic aspects of persistent homology. For a long time, improvements of the standard reduction algorithm to compute the bar code of a filtration have focused on either practical improvements or preprocessing the filtration to reduce its size, thereby improving the runtime. We will outline an approach based on exploiting the doubling dimension, a measure of intrinsic dimensionality, of the considered data set, and use it to present methods to approximate both the Czech filtration as well as the multicover filtration. We obtain a subquadratic approximation algorithm for the computation of the bar code for the Czech filtration, with approximation quality depending on the doubling dimension of the data set.

						Sabrina Streipert: An evolutionary epidemic model to study the impact of tolerance on disease-induced recoveries
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Recoveries of populations that have suffered severe disease-induced declines are being observed across disparate taxa. Yet, we lack theoretical understanding of the drivers and dynamics of recovery in host populations. Motivated by diseaseinduced declines and nascent recoveries in amphibians, we developed a model to ask: how does the rapid evolution of different host defense strategies affect the transient recovery trajectories of hosts following pathogen invasion and disease-induced declines? Our model, based on a moment closure pproximation, provided key insights into the transient effects of different defense mechanisms. Furthermore, populations evolving tolerance recovered on average four times slower than populations evolving resistance. This motivated the long-term study of a tolerance evolving host species. We found that in the presence of a trade-off, where a higher tolerance comes at the expense of a lower reproductive rate, the set of pandemic equilibria increases in richness to contain equilibria where different tolerance classes are present, contrasting the results obtained in the absence of such trade-off.

						Kamil Fortuna: Bonds in systemic risk: linking debt models with network dynamics reveals paths to ruin
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The fragility of financial systems was starkly demonstrated in early 2023 by a cascade of major bank failures in the United States, including the second, third, and fourth largest collapses in U.S. history. Several entities had accumulated significant exposures to technology business that was highly profitable in a low interest rate environment. The contraction of favorable lending conditions created turbulence across banks, amplified by the complex network of relationships within the financial system.
Current methods of systemic risk assessment tend to overlook fundamental aspects of credit dynamics, focusing instead on the process of stress contagion. However, these elements are crucial for understanding market development and can significantly influence the risk analysis. In our research, risk estimation methods are enhanced by integration of debt valuation models with the network evolution of financial systems. Our results demonstrate that this framework can detect potential cascading failures that standard approaches might miss. The proposed risk assessment methodology can assist regulatory bodies in preventing future failures, while also enabling companies to more accurately predict periods of turmoil and strengthen their survivability during such events.

						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I will present findings from a medical experiment that employed mass spectrometry-based proteomics to analyze follicular fluid samples. Mass spectrometry, coupled with liquid chromatography, produces highly multidimensional datasets, making it a potential domain for the application of topological data analysis. The talk will begin with an introduction to the fundamentals of proteomics, mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography, providing a foundation for understanding the experimental workflow. I will then discuss our recent findings, highlighting key discoveries and the potential of TDA to reveal novel patterns and relationships within the data. Finally, I will outline several open questions and challenges we aim to address using this dataset.

						Justyna Signerska-Rynkowska: Low-dimensional dynamics enhancing modeling of neuronal activity (talk at IMPAN Colloquium)
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The talk will start with a brief introduction to the history of neuron modelling, including models of Lapicque, Hodgkin-Huxley and FitzHugh-Nagumo. These pioneering models were proposed decades ago and since then many other models arose, including hybrid systems combining continuous dynamics with discrete resets accounting for neuronal spiking. Due to the variety of these models, it is important to indicate the most universal and reliable tools allowing understanding dynamical mechanisms shaping their properties, related to diversity of neuronal activity and biological relevance. We will see how the theory of low dimensional dynamics (e.g. rotation theory, S-unimodal maps, phase-space methods) can be effectively applied in the analysis of map-based and hybrid neuron models, commonly used in computational and theoretical neuroscience. I will also mention recent tools adapted from nonlinear time series analysis and computational topology facilitating, among others, classification of spike-trains and phase-portraits in neuron models.

						Sergio Ardanza-Trevijano: Topological data analysis of granular materials via persistence curves 
 
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The typical topological data analysis pipeline using persistent homology in volves the choice of a simplicial complex filtration, a vectorization (or kernel) method, and a statistical/machine learning procedure. Choosing the right tool at each step has deep implications for the type of information obtained at the end of the process. We will focus on the vectorization process and show the benefits of combining different persistent curves applied in a granular material context.

						Aras Asaad: Topological Data Analysis to detect fake face images.

						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b>  In this talk, I will discuss the use of persistent homology, one of the main tools in the field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), to detect fake face images. The main application we are considering is the case of using fake photographs to produce fake passports by criminals to cross borders illegally. Beside discussing challenges faced by security officers to distinguish a genuine face from a morphed/fake face, we also discuss the vulnerability of face recognition systems deployed in airports and borders whereby they accept these fake faces as a genuine photograph. We argue that one can use tools from the field of TDA to design sophisticated machine learning pipelines to distinguish deepfake generated faces from their bona fide counterparts.

						John Rick: Stable Homology-Based Cycle Centrality Measures
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b>  Network centrality measures are fundamental in evaluating the importance of nodes and paths within graph structures. Existing centrality functions have been extended to simplicial complexes to capture higher-order connections. In this work, we propose novel centrality measures based on algebraically computable topological signatures of cycles and their homological persistence. This approach integrates persistent homology to quantify the significance of cycles by accounting for both their geometric and homological influence. We demonstrate the stability of these measures under small perturbations and apply them to fractal-like point clouds, revealing insights that surpass those provided by conventional topological summaries.

						Julian Br&uuml;ggemann (MPIM Bonn): On discrete Morse theory in persistent topology
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Discrete Morse theory is a versatile tool in combinatorial algebraic topology
						for the investigation of cell complexes of many different flavors. Persistent topology is the
						study of filtered spaces using topological techniques, which are ubiquitous in topological data
						analysis.In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to peristent topology and motivate the
						subject with topological data analysis. After that I will present results from my PhD thesis: an
						investigation of the inverse problem between discrete Morse functions on graphs and their
						induced (generalized) merge trees, as well as a novel model for the moduli space of discrete
						Morse functions and its relationship to smooth Morse theory, discrete Morse matchings, merge
						trees, and barcodes. In these projects, I mostly use concepts from graph theory, poset theory,
						combinatorial topology, combinatorial geometry, differential topology, and differential
						geometry.

						<b>Abstract:</b>Laser CT scanning of human tissue-equivalent polymer gel dosimetry enables
						three-dimensional mapping of absorbed dose distributions with submillimeter spatial resolution.
						It is therefore a potentially valuable method for pre-treatment verification of cancer

						<b>Abstract:</b>We propose a mathematical model to achieve automatic cell tracking of

						Based on the segmented images, the partial trajectories are extracted first when segmented cells

						<b>Abstract:</b>
						In this talk, I will present joint efforts to develop an analogy of Morse Theory for functions
						with values in R^k, k>1, in the context of multi-filtered persistent homology. In [1], a

						R.U. Gobithaasan: Exploring Malaysian Rainfall Time Series Patterns with Topological Data
						Analysis: A Case Study in Terengganu
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Due to its equatorial location, Malaysia has a tropical climate characterized
						by sunshine and rainstorms throughout the year. Identifying patterns in the Malaysian rainfall
						time series (RTS) can be a challenging task, especially with the impact of climate change.
						Recently, several reports have demonstrated the success of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in
						extracting meaningful insights from incomplete, noisy, and high-dimensional datasets. In this
						study, we utilized two TDA methodologies, Persistent Homology (PH) and the Mapper algorithm, to
						analyze the RTS collected from 66 rainfall stations in Terengganu, Malaysia. Firstly, we
						employed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and PH for classification and clustering tasks and compared
						the results with satellite gridded data. Secondly, we used Mapper to create a spatiotemporal
						network that revealed the connection between RTS and interannual and annual events causing
						floods in Terengganu, Malaysia. This case study is a work-in-progress identifying the advantage
						of TDA methodologies for analyzing time series datasets and, hence providing a foundation for
						informed decision-making.

						<b>Abstract:</b> Nonlinear dynamical systems often exhibit rich and complicated recurrent
						dynamics. Understanding these dynamics is challenging, especially in higher dimensions where

						available. This motivates our TDA-based approach to study such systems. More precisely, we
						introduce the cycling signature which is constructed by taking persistent homology of time
						series segments in a suitable ambient space. Oscillations in a time series can then be

						Waclaw Marzantowicz: The covering type = a homotopy invariant useful also in the study of the

						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b>
						In 2017 M. Karoubi and Ch. Weibel introduced a notion of “the covering type” ${\rm ct}(X)$ of a
						space $X$ as the minimal cardinality of a good cover of $X$ minimized over all $Y$ which are
						homotopy equivalent to $X$. They showed a few fundamental properties of this invariant. In
						particular it estimates from below the number of vertices of any triangulation $K$ of $X$.
						Later, other authors in a couple of papers presented next properties of this invariant, in
						particular giving an its estimate from below by the maximal weighted length of a multiply in the
						cohomology ring of $X$. This let to get estimates of the minimal number of vertices which are
						necessary to triangulate a space including such spaces for which this problem was not studied by
						direct combinatorial methods. However, there are also other attempts to study the problem of
						estimate the number of vertices. They are based on a computer assisted proofs which derive of
						some homotopy invariants of a complex provide the number of vertices is small. We also present
						briefly one of them.

						Lukasz Michalak (AMU): Reeb graph invariants of Morse functions, manifolds and groups
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The Reeb graph of a smooth function on a closed manifold is obtained by
						contracting each connected component of a level set of the function. There are two necessary and
						sufficient conditions for a finite graph to be realized as the Reeb graph of a smooth function
						with finitely many critical points: it needs to have the so-called good orientation and its
						first Betti number cannot exceed the corank of the fundamental group of a given closed manifold.
						Moreover, any free quotient of this group can be represented as the Reeb epimorphism of a Morse
						function which is induced on fundamental groups by the quotient map from the manifold to the
						Reeb graph. However, the realization of a graph as the Reeb graph of a Morse function is
						possible only up to a homeomorphism of graphs in general. The minimum number of degree 2
						vertices in Reeb graphs of Morse functions is a strong invariant of the topology of manifold. It
						has three essentially different lower bounds in terms of the fundamental group, homology groups
						and Lusternik-Schnirelmann category. In the case of orientable 3-manifolds all of them can be
						improved by the inequality involving the Heegaard genus, and there is also another lower bound
						by a new invariant defined in terms of finite presentations of the fundamental group. We use
						Freiheitssatz, a fundamental fact from one-relator groups, to calculate it in some cases. The
						equalities in these bounds are closely related with the problem of finding a function such that
						the first Betti number of its Reeb graph is equal to corank. It is a one of potential geometric
						methods of calculating the corank, which is quite a complicated task in practise.

						Julian Br&uuml;ggemann (MPIM Bonn): Discrete Morse Functions and Merge Trees
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Discrete Morse Theory is a versatile tool to analyze regular CW complexes and,
						in particular, simplicial complexes in many contexts. We focus on the sublevel filtration
						induced by a discrete Morse function and on the persistent connectivity of said filtration.
						The combinatorial data of persistent connectivity can be tracked by the induced merge tree. In
						this talk, I will give a short introduction to merge trees and discuss the case of discrete
						Morse functions on multigraphs. For that case, I will discuss sublevel-symmetry equivalences and
						component-merge equivalences under which the induced merge tree turns out to be invariant. These
						notions of equivalence lead to a classification result for discrete Morse functions on
						multigraphs: Any discrete Morse function on a tree is up to matched cells, symmetry
						equivalences, and component-merge equivalences uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of
						its induced Morse-labeled merge tree.
						If time permits, we take a look at under which conditions this result can be restricted to the
						case of simple graphs and how the induced merge tree can be used to find cancellations of
						critical cells.

						<b>Abstract:</b> Despite its name, the Reeb graph of a smooth function may

						sufficiently wide class of functions, namely, smooth functions with a

						properties that characterize the Reeb graphs defined by functions of a
						given class (say, Morse or Morse-Bott), on a given manifold. In
						particular, can a given graph be the Reeb graph of a Morse function or
						a function of a given class, or even some smooth function? We will
						discuss these and some similar problems. That is, properties of the

						Leonid Fedorov (MPI Tuebingen): Structure in free viewing of natural scenes
						<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b>When one looks at a picture, for e.g. a natural scene, eye-movement trajectories
						appear random, even upon repeated viewing, and vary from subject to subject. Previous studies of
						the oculomotor system have shown that much of these eye movements are ballistic jumps between
						fixation points. Around every fixation point, part of a viewed scene is a signal transmitted
						through the fovea, which is then transformed and processed further along the visual system.
						Specific transformations of this raw signal are often modeled in various ways depending on part
						of the visual system. Further, a full set of these signals is often analyzed using some metric.
						The models, the metric, the eye movement trajectories, and a set of image patches have been
						subjects of prior research. Here we show that given a set of such signals from any viewing, and
						assuming that some metric (any metric) would be used in analysis, there always exists a
						partition of this set. Assuming a point-wise transformation on the set of signals, every subset
						forms an order complex, which is invariant under this transformation. Therefore, eye movements
						in free viewing can be thought of as a collection of order complexes, with vertices being the
						signals, irrespective of how diverse the eye movement trajectories appears in data. We then
						provide a deterministic algorithm to calculate such a partition and a data structure that shows
						how distance data is organized, when partitioned. We discuss that either a finite number of
						partitions can be calculated based on number of fixations, or further modeling assumptions need
						to be made for the partition to also be unique. The implementation of the algorithm and an
						example on data are in progress.

						Matt Burfitt (Aberdeen): Topological approaches to the analysis of Fast Field-Cycling MRI
						images<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Fast Field-Cycling MRI (FFC MRI) has the potential to recover new
						biomarkers form a range of diseases by scanning a number of low
						magnetic field strengths simultaneously. The images produced by an FFC
						scanner can be interpreted in the form of a sequence times series of
						2-dimensional grey scale images with each times series corresponding
						to each of the magnetic field strengths. I will investigate the
						applications of topology and machine learning to brain stroke images
						obtained by the FFC MRI scanner.
						A main obstacle to achieving good results lies in multiplicative
						brightness errors occurring in the data. A simple solution might be
						to consider pixelwise image feature vectors initially only up to
						multiplication by a constant. This can be thought of as splitting the
						data point cloud within a product by first embedding into standard
						n-simplices. We observe that this point cloud embedding can provide
						good information on tissue types which when modelled against the other
						component of the data point cloud can be used to highlight stroke
						damaged tissue.

						A drawback of the first method is that it discarded the pixel spatial
						locations information of the image. However, this can be captured by
						persistent homology in a parameter choice free process. A direct
						comparison between pixel intensity histograms and the Betti curves
						reveals that homology captures and emphasises tissue signals.
						Moreover, addition geometric and topological information about the
						images is captured with persistent homology, in particular by
						considering changes between images at differing fields and times. From
						here the ultimately aim is to extract persistent homology features
						useful for machine leaning and develop new visual diagnostics for the
						FFC data.

						Yonatan Gutman: Optimal Embedding of Topological Dynamical Systems<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b>Given a metrizable space $X$ of dimension $d$ it is a classical fact that the
						minimal $n$ which guarantees that $X$ may be embedded topologically in
						$[0,1]^n$, is $n=2d+1$.An analogous problem in the category of
						dynamical systems,
						is under what conditions one can guarantee that a
						topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ embeds in $([0,1]^n)^\mathbb{Z}$
						under the shift action. This problem witnessed
						a rapid development in the last 20 years starting with Gromov's
						introduction of the invariant of mean dimension (1999) and the
						breakthrough results of Lindenstrauss and Weiss (2000). We will
						present our joint result with Tusukamoto concerning optimal embedding
						of minimal systems (2020) whose proof offers a surprising connection
						to signal analysis.

						Micha&#322; Lipi&#324;ski: Morse pre-decomposition of an invariant set <br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> An invariant set is a central object in the study of dynamical systems. We can
						reveal the internal structure of the set by decomposing it into gradient and recurrent parts. In
						particular, the recurrent parts (stationary points, periodic orbits, etc.) are sealed together
						with gradient-like trajectories. As a result, we get a Morse decomposition, a collection of
						isolated invariant sets (Morse sets) partially ordered by connecting trajectories. In this talk,
						I will present some results concerning the extension of the idea of Morse decomposition. The
						refined construction will allow studying the internal structure of recurrent parts of the
						decomposition. It is achieved by replacing the partial order with a preorder.

						Federica Buccino: Micro-cracks and lacunae in human bones: a debated mechanobiological
						link<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The increase in fragility fractures and the related dramatic impact on the
						healthcare and financial system, raise a big red flag, especially in the approach to the
						clinical treatment. With the rise in life expectancy, the prevalence of chronic conditions, such
						as osteoporosis, is also set to escalate. All these contributing factors highlight the need and
						urgency to address the fragility fracture crisis with a critical eye on the intricate
						multi-scale arrangement of bone structure. Indeed, despite the evident health- and
						economic-related interests about bone fracture, its comprehension is still limited to macro-(50
						cm-10 mm) and meso-scale (10 mm-500 &#181;m) level, where its occurrence is however
						catastrophic. It is still unclear what befalls at the micro-scale (500 &#181;m -1 &#181;m) from
						a mechanobiological point of view and what is the role of microscopic bone porosities, named
						lacunae, during the damage processes. This is mainly due to the complexity of the parameters to
						be considered when dealing with bone fractures, such as bone's structural and morphological
						features and their cross-relationships with damage initiation and propagation. More in depth,
						there exists a dualism behind the role of lacunae: they seem to play an antithetical mechanical
						contribution, having an effect on both strength and toughness.
						For these reasons, recent studies address the issue from a multi-scale perspective, elevating
						the micro-scale phenomena as the key for detecting early damage occurrence. However, several
						limitations arise specifically for defining a quantitative framework to assess the contribution
						of lacunar micro-pores to fracture initiation and propagation. Moreover, the need for high
						resolution imaging imposes time-demanding post-processing phases.
						To overcome these issues, we exploit synchrotron scans in combination with micro-mechanical
						tests, to offer a fracture mechanics-based approach for quantifying the critical stress
						intensification in healthy and osteoporotic trabecular human bones. This is paired with a
						morphological and densitometric framework for capturing lacunar network differences in presence
						of pathological alterations. To address the current time-consuming and computationally expensive
						manual/semi-automatic segmenting steps, we implement convolutional neural network to detect the
						initiation and propagation of micro-scale damages. The results highlight the intimate cross
						talks between toughening and weakening phenomena at micro-scale as a fundamental aspect for
						fracture prevention.

						Bartosz Naskr&#281;cki: Crystallographic tesselations and growth polynomials<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> We consider the Euclidean space R^N with a CW-tesselation which is transformed
						regularly by a crystallographic group. Such a group is naturally associated with a flat
						orbifold, obtained from the N-dimensional torus under the action of a certain finite group. I
						will explain the relation of this orbifold with the polynomials that count the number of cells
						in our tesselation treated as an expanding CW-complex. The natural choice of the vertex of the
						tesselation leads to growth functions which are polynomials of degree N for every fixed cell
						dimension. The leading terms of these growth polynomials form a vector which up to constant
						characterizes the flat tesselation orbifold. I will also explain the role of the lower order
						terms in these polynomials based on some calculations with fundamental domains of the
						crystallographic group. In practice, this leads to a simple concrete algorithm which allows one
						to recognize the crystallographic group from a partial data about tesselation.

						Tamal Dey (Purdue): Computing Generalized Rank Invariant for 2-parameter Persistence Modules via
						Zigzag Persistence<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> The notion of generalized rank invariant in the context of multiparameter
						persistence has become an important ingredient for defining interesting homological structures
						such as generalized persistence diagrams. Naturally, computing these rank invariants efficiently
						is a prelude to computing any of these derived structures efficiently. We show that the
						generalized rank over a finite interval I of a Z^2-indexed persistence module M is equal to the
						generalized rank of the zigzag module that is induced on a certain path in I tracing mostly its
						boundary. Hence, we can compute the generalized rank over I by computing the barcode of the
						zigzag module obtained by restricting the bifiltration inducing M to that path. If I has t
						points, this computation takes O(t^\omega) time where \omega\in[2,2.373) is the exponent of
						matrix multiplication. Among others, we apply this result to obtain an improved algorithm for
						the following problem. Given a bifiltration inducing a module M, determine whether M is interval
						decomposable and, if so, compute all intervals supporting its summands.

						Anastasios Stefanou (Uni Bremen): Multiparameter persistence meets Gr&ouml;bner bases.<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Ordinary persistent homology extends from one parameter to multiparameter
						filtrations. The resulting algebraic methodology is called multiparameter persistent homology.
						Although multiparameter persistence modules of finite type admit a unique decomposition into
						indecomposables, the indecomposable modules do not always have the structure of a generalized
						interval module. Thus, to study these multigraded module structures one has to use alternative
						algebraic tools to present them. One such tool is called minimal free resolutions. A known
						result in homological algebra is that any $N^n$-graded module admits a unique minimal free
						resolution (up to a non-canonical notion of equivalence). Although these resolutions are not
						unique for the module in the standard sense, there are ways on which one can utilize the theory
						of Gr&ouml;bner bases to explicitly construct a minimal free resolution for the persistent
						module of a given multifiltration. The output minimal free resolution depends on (i) choosing a
						monomial order in the polynomial ring R:=K[x1,\ldots,x_n] (e.g. the lexicographic order) and
						(ii) on other things, e.g. choosing an ordering on the simplices of the input multi-filtered
						complex. In this talk I will give an introduction on Gr&ouml;bner bases over R^l, and discuss
						how Gr&ouml;bner bases can be useful in multiparameter persistence.

						Kunal Dutta (University of Warsaw): On Dimensionality Reduction for Persistent Homology<br />
						<b>Abstract:</b> Given a point cloud in a high-dimensional space, we are interested in computing
						the persistent homology of the Cech filtration while avoiding the curse of dimensionality, and
						investigate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction for this problem.
						This line of work was initiated by Sheehy [SoCG 2014] who showed that any
						map preserving pairwise distances between points up to a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$
						factor, also preserves the Cech filtration up to a $(1 \pm 4\varepsilon)$ factor.
						We'll follow the work of Sheehy [2014] and Lotz [Proc. Roy. Soc., 2019], before
						arriving at the result of [Arya, Boissonnat, D., Lotz, J. App. Comp. Topol., 2021],
						which answers an open question of Sheehy regarding dimensionality reduction for
						persistent homology computed using the \emph{$k$-distance}, or \emph{distance to a measure}.
						We show that any linear transformation that preserves pairwise distances up
						to a $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ multiplicative factor, must preserve the persistent homology
						of the &#268;ech filtration, computed using the $k$-distance,
						up to a factor of $(1 - \varepsilon)^{-1}$. Our results also hold for
						the Vietoris-Rips and Delaunay filtrations for the $k$-distance, as well
						as the &#268;ech filtration for the approximate $k$-distance of Buchet et al.
						[Comput. Geom., 2016].
						We'll also look at several extensions of this result, for point sets (i) lying in a
						region of bounded Gaussian width or (ii) on a low-dimensional manifold,
						obtaining the target dimension bounds of Lotz [Proc. Roy. Soc., 2019] and
						Clarkson [Proc. SoCG, 2008 ] respectively.

						<b>Abstract:</b> In TDA, Bottleneck and interleaving distances and their variants are common

						varying scales. Algebraically speaking, this construction can be thought of measuring how far
						two persistence modules are from being interleaved. In addition, one easily obtains a rich

						Davide Gurnari: Distributed algorithms for Euler Characteristic Curves<br />

						<b>Abstract:</b> The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is the alternate sum of its
						Betti number, or equivalently the alternating sum of the number of simplices of following
						dimensions. For a filtered complex the Euler Characteristic Curve is a function that assigns an
						Euler number to each filtration level. ECCs are closely related to persistence diagrams via the
						fundamental theorem of persistent homology and stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein
						distance can be proven under certain conditions.
						The first part of this talk we will introduce the concept of ECC and prove its stability with
						respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance. In the second part we will present new techniques to
						compute the ECC of filtered Vietoris-Rips complexes. By following a distributed approach, the
						contributions to the ECC can be computed locally without having to explicitly build up the whole
						complex. This allows us to significatively reduce both time and memory requirements, giving us
						the opportunity to tackle much larger datasets compared to, for instance, persistent homology.
						An implementation of such algorithms is available as a scikit-learn-compatible Python package.
						Finally, we will discuss how such ideas and algorithms can be adapted to work in the
						multiparameter persistence setting.

						<b>Abstract:</b> In the talk, I will present a generalization of the theory of multivector
						fields which can be seen as a combinatorial counterpart of vector fields induced by continuous

						Robin Forman and was later extended by Marian Mrozek to multivector fields for Lefschetz
						complexes.
						Our generalization involves three fundamental changes, which will be explained during the talk.
						Consequently, the theory becomes more flexible and handy in applications. Moreover, we can
						introduce a new interpretation of a multivector as a dynamical "black box."
						With the new settings, we define combinatorial counterparts of multiple objects from the
						classical theory of dynamical systems, among others: isolated invariant set, index pair, Conley
						index, limit set, attractor, or Morse decomposition. We also show that the desirable properties
						as additivity of a Conley index and Morse inequalities hold.
						Furthermore, we use persistent homology to study the robustness of the structure of Morse sets.
						In particular, we construct a zigzag persistence module for Morse decomposition for multivector
						fields.
						Finally, we will present some numerical experiments based on the presented theory.

						Jan F. Senge: Topological descriptors for surface roughness of shot peened surfaces<br />


						<b>Abstract:</b> Surface topography and roughness evaluation plays an important role in many
						problems such as friction, contact deformation or coat adhesion. Impact surface treatments can
						be used to improve the properties of the treated surface in the cases mentioned. Different
						roughness parameters like the arithmetic average height deviation, root mean square height or
						skewness are used to describe the topography of a surface and constitute the most used features
						to describe changes occurred during impact treatment. Depending on the surface treatment process
						considered, standard roughness parameters may struggle to exhibit differences between surface
						samples of the same material at different stages of the process. As an extension the work done
						to improve existing methods and find new descriptors, we consider methods from computational
						topology, namely persistent homology to capture meaningful geometric features of the surface and
						use that to construct new surface roughness parameters better able to distinguish surface
						samples. Furthermore, invariants such as the persistence diagram have been studied extensively
						in the last years and provide a rich structure which can be exploited using a plethora of
						different machine learning techniques. In the talk, I give an introduction into existing
						standards for surface roughness measurement and compare how well persistence-based parameters
						perform for classification and clustering tasks in the case of the shot peening surface
						treatment process opposed to conventional roughness parameters mentioned in these standards.

			Austin Lawson (UNC Greensboro): Persistence Curves: A canonical framework for summarizing persistence diagrams</br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> As Topological Data Analysis (TDA) grows in popularity so too does the need
			for topological methods compatible with modern machine learning algorithms.
			The use of machine learning algorithms directly on the space of persistence diagrams is challenging.
			For that reason, transforming these diagrams in a way that is compatible with machine learning is an important topic currently researched in TDA.
			A promising avenue in this vein involves mapping a persistence diagram to a real-valued summary function or vector
			that maintains the topological information contained in the diagram. Inspired by persistent Betti numbers,
			we discover a canonical way to generate these mappings, which we call the Persistence Curve Framework.
			In this talk, we will (1) define the framework and show that subsumes several other recent summary functions including the persistence landscapes;
			(2) explore theoretical results including stability; (3) demonstrate some recent applications using the PC framework including texture analysis,
			time series classification, and skin lesion analysis; and finally (4) we will discuss the future of applications and theoretical development of the framework.</li>

			understanding of protein-protein interaction, protein classification,
			and structure. We will show our recent advances in the application of
			Euler Characteristic and local curvature analysis applied to large
			proteins and their molecular dynamics, and the insight about the role of
			high dimensional simplicies for modeling such systems. The technical
			difficulties found in processing the big data required for the modeling,
			as well as perspectives of the application of the discrete formulation
			of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, will also be discussed. </li>

			Michael Grinfeld (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow): Topological Data Analysis techniques: unity in variety<br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> Given present-day vast computational resources, 21st century
			has seen a rapid development of techniques of topological data
			analysis. In addition to persistent homology, these techniques include
			Minkowski functionals and visibility graphs. I will review the
			Minkwoski functionals (and tensors) approach and the idea of a
			visibility graph, and will open for discussion two questions that
			seem to me to be central in this area: (a) which properties of the
			data are best captured by a which particular technique and (b) how are
			the different techniques connected, i.e. whether findings from one
			framework can be translated directly into results obtained by
			another. The thoughts on (a) and (b) will be very preliminary!</li>
